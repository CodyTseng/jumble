# NIP-57 Zap Implementation Status

**UPDATE - October 31, 2025**: ðŸŽ‰ **BREEZ HAS ADDED NIP57 SUPPORT!**

PR #317 "Nostr Zap support" was merged to spark-sdk on October 31, 2025. We have upgraded to SDK v0.3.4 and are ready for testing.

## Summary
The Spark wallet integration has **full NIP-57 zap support** on both the SDK backend and in our client code. Ready for end-to-end testing!

## What Works âœ…

### Outgoing Zaps (Sending)
- âœ… Send zaps from Spark wallet to any Lightning address
- âœ… Proper NIP-57 zap request creation (kind 9734)
- âœ… Zap request included in invoice description
- âœ… Payment via Spark wallet
- âœ… Works with all Nostr clients and profiles

**Implementation:** `src/services/lightning.service.ts` (lines 89-107)

### Incoming Zap Receipt Publishing
- âœ… Automatic detection of incoming zap payments
- âœ… Extract zap request from payment description
- âœ… Build NIP-57 compliant zap receipts (kind 9735)
- âœ… Publish to Nostr relays with all required tags:
  - `bolt11` tag (invoice)
  - `description` tag (zap request)
  - `p` tag (sender pubkey)
  - `P` tag (recipient pubkey)
  - `preimage` tag
  - `e`/`a` tags (if zapping specific content)
  - `relays` tag

**Implementation:**
- `src/services/spark-zap-receipt.service.ts` (complete service)
- `src/providers/SparkWalletProvider.tsx` (lines 172-207)

### Regular Lightning Payments
- âœ… Send payments via Spark wallet
- âœ… Receive payments to `@breez.tips` address
- âœ… Payment notifications and balance updates
- âœ… Invoice generation

## What Should Now Work âœ… (Pending Testing)

### Receiving Zaps to Breez Lightning Address
- âœ… SDK v0.3.4 includes backend NIP57 support
- âœ… LNURL responses should include `allowsNostr` and `nostrPubkey`
- âœ… Can use `@breez.tips` address as `lud16` in Nostr profile
- ðŸ§ª **Needs manual testing to confirm**

## Testing Required

### Verify LNURL Response
```bash
curl https://breez.tips/.well-known/lnurlp/{your-username}
```

**Expected Response (with SDK v0.3.4):**
```json
{
  "callback": "https://breez.tips/lnurlp/{username}/invoice",
  "maxSendable": 4000000000,
  "minSendable": 1000,
  "tag": "payRequest",
  "metadata": "[[\"text/plain\",\"Pay breez.tips user\"],[\"text/identifier\",\"{username}@breez.tips\"]]",
  "allowsNostr": true,           // âœ… Should now be present
  "nostrPubkey": "<hex-pubkey>"  // âœ… Should now be present
}
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works Now

1. **Backend Implementation**: Breez added server-side zap handling (PR #317)
2. **Automatic NIP57**: Lightning addresses automatically get NIP57 support
3. **No Client Changes**: Our existing registration code works as-is
4. **Smart Monitoring**: Backend subscribes to Nostr events when zap invoices are open

### SDK Integration
The SDK `registerLightningAddress()` interface remains unchanged:
```typescript
{
  username: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

The backend server automatically adds NIP57 metadata to LNURL responses.

## What's Been Done

### Implementation (Complete)
1. âœ… Zap receipt publishing service created
2. âœ… Payment event handler integrated
3. âœ… Auto-sync feature implemented (currently disabled)
4. âœ… Code documented with limitation notes
5. âœ… Feature request drafted for Breez team

### Temporary Measures
1. âœ… Auto-sync to profile **disabled** (no point syncing address that doesn't work for zaps)
2. âœ… Code comments added explaining limitation
3. âœ… Documentation created

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. âœ… Upgrade SDK to 0.3.4 (done)
2. âœ… Fix breaking changes (done)
3. âœ… Build successfully (done)
4. ðŸ§ª **Test Lightning address registration**
5. ðŸ§ª **Verify LNURL response includes NIP57 fields**
6. ðŸ§ª **Receive test zap and confirm receipt publishing**

### Optional Enhancements
1. Re-enable auto-sync in `SparkWalletProvider.tsx` (lines 136-168)
2. Add UI toggle for profile sync preference
3. Update user documentation with zap receiving guide

### Documentation
- See `BREEZ_NIP57_INTEGRATION.md` for full integration details
- See `BREEZ_NIP57_FEATURE_REQUEST.md` for historical context (can archive)

## Testing

### To Test Sending Zaps
1. Connect Spark wallet
2. Zap any note or profile in the app
3. âœ… Should work perfectly

### To Test Receiving Zaps (Once Breez Adds Support)
1. Share your `@breez.tips` address
2. Have someone zap you from any Nostr client
3. Check browser console for:
   - `[SparkWalletProvider] Incoming payment received, checking for zap...`
   - `[SparkZapReceipt] Zap request found`
   - `[SparkZapReceipt] âœ… Zap receipt published: <event_id>`
4. Verify zap receipt appears in clients
